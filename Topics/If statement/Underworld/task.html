<h2>Underworld</h2>
<html><body><p>Charon the Ferryman carries souls across the river Styx to the world of the dead but does so only for a fee. It's a business after all.</p>
<p>Check whether the recently deceased has a coin. If they do, print <code class="java">Welcome to Charon's boat!</code></p>
<p>The variable <code class="java">coin</code> stores a Boolean value, so it qualifies as a condition. If <code class="java">coin</code> has False value, alas! There's <strong>nothing to be done</strong> about it.</p>
<p>In the end, let's warn <strong><samp>everyone</samp></strong> in the underworld (<em>both those in the boat and those overboard</em>) by printing the message <code class="java">There is no turning back.</code></p></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
